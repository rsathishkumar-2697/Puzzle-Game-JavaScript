## Game Instructions
The board starts with numbered tiles in order, and the board is automatically 
shuffled after a few seconds. The purpose of the game is to place tiles back
in their original order by swapping the empty tile with adjacent tiles. Adjacent
tiles can be swapped by clicking on them or using the arrow keys.
